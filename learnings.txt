IIFE is useful because can call the functions from other modules without having to re-run the entire thing
Re-running the entire thing is problematic for many reasons ie it will try to re-render stuff (?)

That means, the plan of sending the parent node won't work to make the other elements, because their functions can't be accessed

But, they can be accessed by the initial funtion that called them... useful or confusing? Kind of like a hub
    This works, but not sure if it is strange or not
