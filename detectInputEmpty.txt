css for changing the style of an input field

1)
:placeholder-shown
:not(:placeholder-shown)

if the placeholder is present (even if it just a space), then use this style


2)
if the element has the required attribute
:invalid will trigger if the value is empty, :valid if it is not empty

3)
:empty triggers for elements that have no children (eg element nodes, or text)
doesn't seem to work for input though (?)
